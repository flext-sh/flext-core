"""Coverage stubs for utilities methods tested elsewhere.

Tested modules: Various flext_core._utilities modules
Test scope: Placeholder tests for utilities coverage where methods are tested
in specialized coverage modules (e.g., _coverage_100.py files).

This module provides placeholder tests to ensure coverage tools recognize
the utilities module structure while actual comprehensive tests are in
dedicated coverage files.
